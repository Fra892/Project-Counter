## Heap (Priority Queue)

A **heap**, also known as a **priority queue**, is a nearly balanced **binary tree** that can be efficiently stored in an array. It has the following properties:

- The nodes are as far **left-aligned** as possible (especially noticeable in the last level of the tree).
- For any given node, the value of the **root** is either **greater than or equal to** (in a max-heap) or **less than or equal to** (in a min-heap) the values of its descendants.

### Types of Heap

- **Max-heap**: For any node, the values in its subtrees are **less than or equal to** its value.  
  → The root of the heap contains the **maximum** value.

- **Min-heap**: For any node, the values in its subtrees are **greater than or equal to** its value.  
  → The root of the heap contains the **minimum** value.
