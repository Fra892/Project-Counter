# Competitive Programming Notes & Problems

This is a personal collection of notes and problems related to **Competitive Programming (CP)**.

I'm still learning — I've been studying CP on and off for about a year — so this is not meant to be a complete or expert-level guide. Instead, it's a way for me to organize and deepen my understanding of the concepts I'm learning.

## What This Is

Each topic includes a explanation of the theory (as clearly as I can manage), along with a selection of problems that show how the theory can be applied in practice.

Putting theory and problems side by side helps me (and hopefully others) to:

- better understand how algorithms and data structures actually work;  
- get more comfortable solving problems;  
- build up a solid foundation for contests or interviews.

## Why I'm Sharing This

I’m sharing these notes in case they’re helpful to anyone else who's also learning or wants to review the basics. Keep in mind that I'm not an expert, and some explanations might be incomplete or slightly off — feedback is always welcome!

## Structure

Topics are grouped by category (like sorting, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, etc.) and usually include:

- **Theory and standard problems**  
- **Variations on Specific Problems**  
- **My solutions or notes on how i approached them**  
- **Links to related resources**
